# Language Course Admin UI (React)

This is the React frontend for the Language Course Admin tool. Use this interface to add new languages, courses, units, lessons, vocabulary, grammar rules, phrases, and exercises without writing SQL queries!

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The backend should be running at `/server` (Node.js/Express + MySQL).
